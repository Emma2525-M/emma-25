        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p>
            David Backes was born on May 1, 1984 (age 35) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. The St. Louis Blues had drafted David Backes, developed him and fully acknowledged what they'd be relinquishing should he exit. But they were unwilling to commit long term to a 32-year-old player, and Backes wanted a measure of security. Unrestricted free agency provided that leverage. Following two seasons of being on the outside looking in come playoff time, the Boston Bruins were eager to make a splash in free agency, to add size, grit and leadership. So on July 1, 2016, after five seasons as the captain of the Blues, Backes signed a five-year contract with the Bruins. One of the most respected power forwards in the game had left the only NHL home he'd ever known. Backes was selected by the Blues in the second round (No. 62) in the 2003 NHL Draft, but elected to attend Minnesota State, where he scored 46 goals and had 119 points in 115 games during three seasons. Following a 43-game stint with Peoria of the American Hockey League, he joined the Blues to stay midway through the 2006-07 season. He made his NHL debut on Dec. 19, 2006, and assisted on a goal 44 seconds into a 4-1 victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Two nights later, he scored his first NHL goal in a 5-2 victory against the Los Angeles Kings. On Nov. 12, 2010, with his influence on the ice growing by the season, Backes signed a five-year contract extension. Following defenseman Eric Brewer's trade to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Feb. 18, 2011, Backes was chosen the 20th captain in Blues history. With the Blues mired in a pattern of strong regular seasons followed by early playoff exits, Backes became frustrated. Recognizing the urgency involved, and buoyed by a 107-point regular season, second best in the Western Conference, the Blues made a determined push in the 2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs, but lost to the San Jose Sharks in the conference final. So after 10 years, 206 goals and 460 points in 727 games, Backes left for Boston.
